Welcome to a quick coding proficiency test. We won't keep you long!

You've been added to a project with this partially finished platformer ("GRAMMAR BOY!"), and you've been asked to quickly whip it into shape (use the SampleScene scene)

The requested changes are as follows:

1. The movement doesn't feel very good. Give the player a 0.2 second grace period after they step off a ledge during which they can still jump -- but make sure this doesn't happen when they're already jumping!

2. Add a banner to the top of the screen that shows the title, the number of times the player has died this session, and how long they've been playing since their last respawn. The box should resize to fit the screen.

3. Use PlayerPrefs to track the player's best time and add this to the banner. Have diamonds rain from the sky when the player beats their personal best. Additionally, display a leaderboard of the top 5 scores the player has achieved.

4. The game needs to do more to emphasize the grammar theme. Load the English word list in Assets/Databases, and parse it. Make the player character say (via short-lived, animated text) a random word from the wordlist when he picks up a pickup.

5. The game needs to be localized to Spanish. Add a toggle to the banner that switches the title to spanish ("¡EL NIÑO GRAMÁTICO!"), and change the system to use a word from the Spanish wordlist instead.

6. Reset the game when the player completes it, so they can try to beat their high-score.

7. Create a file documenting the scripts you modified or added to make it easier to grade.
